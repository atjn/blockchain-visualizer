#
# This runs GitHub's own CodeQL analyzer that checks for
# vulnerabilities in the code. It runs on each new commit, but also
# periodically to include new tests that are periodically published
# to this runner.
#
# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing.
#
# We can alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# or to provide custom queries or build logic.
