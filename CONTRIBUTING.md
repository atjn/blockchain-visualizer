# Contributing
Anyone that wants to help improve this project is very welcome.

You are free to work on whatever you want, but if you are looking for suggestions, take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/atjn/blockchain-visualizer/issues). Especially [issues with the `help wanted` label](https://github.com/atjn/blockchain-visualizer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22), which indicates that we would like help from outside programmers. If you are just getting started and are looking for something relatively simple to help out with, you can check out [issues with the `good first issue` label](https://github.com/atjn/blockchain-visualizer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

We ask that you try to understand the codebase yourself, and try to properly understand and fix the issue at hand. We also ask that you test your code with `npm run test` and fix any issues that might come up. If you are adding new code, you should also be adding appropriate unit tests and end-to-end tests for the new features.

With that said, it is OK if you make mistakes or have problems understanding something. You are always welcome to submit an incomplete pull request and ask for help to finish it. You are also welcome to comment on an issue and say that you would like us to help you get started on fixing it.

If you want to build a new feature or do something else that we haven't explicitly asked for, we recommend that you first create an issue to discuss your idea with us. It would be a shame if you spend a lot of time building something that we then reject because it doesn't fit the vision that we have for the project.

Happy contributing!
